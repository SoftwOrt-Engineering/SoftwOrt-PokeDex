## Description
<b>This app is based on an idea from my older son and myself. We designed the app together.</b>

PokeDex from SoftwOrt-Engineering uses the RESTful API from [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/)

All information and language packs about the Pokemons are provided by this API, so internet access is required to use the PokeDex.

Information about the structure of the App:
- The user interface is built in MVVM design. For this purpose the extension from Caliburn Micro is used.
[Caliburn Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/)

- The back-end NuGet for the API control is from [JJ Banda](https://github.com/mtrdp642/PokeApiNet)
